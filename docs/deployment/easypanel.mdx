> **TL;DR –** Deploy Bytebot on your Easypanel instance using Docker Compose or wait for the official one-click template in the Easypanel marketplace.

---

## What is Easypanel?

Easypanel is a modern, open-source server control panel that simplifies application deployment and management. It provides a user-friendly interface for deploying Docker containers, managing databases, and handling SSL certificates.

---

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Compose Deployment (Available Now)

You can deploy Bytebot on Easypanel using the Docker Compose file from the repository.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Access Your Easypanel Instance">
    Log in to your Easypanel dashboard at your server's URL.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="2. Create a New Project">
    Click on "Projects" and create a new project named "bytebot".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="3. Deploy from Docker Compose">
    - In your project, click "Add Service" → "From Docker Compose"
    - Upload or paste the Bytebot docker-compose.yml file
    - Configure environment variables:
      - Add at least one AI provider API key:
        - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude models
        - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for GPT models
        - `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Gemini models
      - The database URL will be automatically configured by Easypanel
      - If manually setting, ensure it matches your PostgreSQL service configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="4. Configure Networking">
    - Ensure the bytebot-ui service is exposed on port 9992
    - Set up a domain or use the Easypanel provided domain
    - Enable SSL/HTTPS for secure access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="5. Deploy">
    Click "Deploy" and wait for all services to start. Monitor the logs to ensure successful deployment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="6. Access Bytebot">
    Once deployed, access the Bytebot UI at your configured domain. You should see the task interface ready to use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: One-Click Template (Coming Soon)

The Bytebot Easypanel template is prepared and will be submitted to the official Easypanel marketplace. Once approved, you'll be able to deploy with a single click.

**What the template includes:**
- Pre-configured services for UI, Agent, Desktop, and Database
- Automatic networking setup between services
- Form-based configuration for API keys
- SSL certificate management
- One-click deployment

---

## Docker Compose Configuration

Here's the Docker Compose configuration for Easypanel deployment:

<Note>
  **Database Configuration**: When using the one-click template, Easypanel automatically uses the project name as the database name. If deploying via Docker Compose manually, you can use a fixed database name like 'bytebotdb' as shown below.
</Note>

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  bytebot-desktop:
    image: ghcr.io/bytebot-ai/bytebot-desktop:edge
    shm_size: "2g"
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=:0
    restart: unless-stopped

  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=bytebotdb
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  bytebot-agent:
    image: ghcr.io/bytebot-ai/bytebot-agent:edge
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/bytebotdb
      - BYTEBOT_DESKTOP_BASE_URL=http://bytebot-desktop:9990
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - GEMINI_API_KEY=${GEMINI_API_KEY}
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - bytebot-desktop
    restart: unless-stopped

  bytebot-ui:
    image: ghcr.io/bytebot-ai/bytebot-ui:edge
    ports:
      - "9992:9992"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - BYTEBOT_AGENT_BASE_URL=http://bytebot-agent:9991
      - BYTEBOT_DESKTOP_VNC_URL=http://bytebot-desktop:9990/websockify
    depends_on:
      - bytebot-agent
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

You must provide at least one AI provider API key:

| Variable | Description | Where to Get |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic Claude API key (recommended) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI GPT API key | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key | [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) |

### Service Ports

| Service | Port | Exposure | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------|---------|
| bytebot-ui | 9992 | Public | Web interface |
| bytebot-agent | 9991 | Internal | Task API |
| bytebot-desktop | 9990 | Internal | Desktop & VNC |
| postgres | 5432 | Internal | Database |

---

## Security Considerations

### Network Isolation
- Only the UI service should be exposed to the public internet
- All internal services communicate via Easypanel's private networking
- Database credentials should be kept secure

### Authentication
- Consider adding authentication to the UI in production
- Use Easypanel's built-in authentication features or an external auth provider
- Keep API keys secure in environment variables

### SSL/HTTPS
- Always enable SSL for production deployments
- Easypanel can automatically manage Let's Encrypt certificates
- Configure your domain properly for SSL to work

---

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum Recommended Specifications

- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Storage**: 20 GB
- **Network**: Stable internet connection

The desktop service requires more resources due to the virtual desktop environment.

### Service Resource Allocation

- **bytebot-desktop**: 1-2 GB RAM, 1 core (can be adjusted)
- **bytebot-agent**: 512 MB RAM, 0.5 core
- **bytebot-ui**: 256 MB RAM, 0.5 core
- **postgres**: 512 MB RAM, 0.5 core

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| UI shows "connecting..." | Desktop service not ready | Wait for desktop container to fully start, check logs |
| Agent returns 401/403 errors | Missing or invalid API key | Verify API key is correctly set in environment variables |
| Slow desktop performance | Insufficient resources | Increase CPU/RAM allocation for desktop service |
| Database connection errors | Database not ready | Ensure postgres service is healthy, check connection string |
| SSL certificate issues | Domain not configured | Properly configure domain in Easypanel, enable auto-SSL |

### Checking Logs

In Easypanel:
1. Navigate to your project
2. Click on a service
3. View the "Logs" tab
4. Look for error messages or startup issues

### Common Issues

**Desktop Container Fails to Start:**
- Ensure privileged mode is enabled for bytebot-desktop
- Check that shm_size is set to at least 2g

**Services Can't Communicate:**
- Verify all services are in the same Easypanel project
- Check that service names match the URLs in environment variables
- Ensure Easypanel's internal networking is working

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain Setup

1. In Easypanel, navigate to your bytebot-ui service
2. Add a custom domain under "Domains"
3. Point your domain's DNS to your Easypanel server
4. Enable SSL for automatic certificate management

### Scaling

For production deployments:
- Increase resources allocated to the desktop service for better performance
- Consider using external PostgreSQL for better reliability
- Set up automated backups of the database volume

### Using External Database

Replace the postgres service with an external database:
1. Remove the postgres service from Docker Compose
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` to point to your external PostgreSQL instance
3. Ensure the database is accessible from your Easypanel server

---

## Updating Bytebot

To update to the latest version:

1. In Easypanel, go to your Bytebot services
2. For each service (ui, agent, desktop), update the image tag
3. Pull the latest `edge` tag or specify a version
4. Restart the services

**Note:** Database schema migrations are handled automatically by the agent service.
